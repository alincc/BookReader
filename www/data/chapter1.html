<h3>Unraveling the Mystery of How
Geckos Defy Gravity</h3>
<p>Science is most fun when it tickles your imagination. This is
particularly true when you see something your common
sense tells you just can’t be true. Imagine, for example, you
are lying on a bed in a tropical hotel room. A little lizard, a
blue gecko about the size of a toothbrush, walks up the wall
beside you and upside down across the ceiling, stopping for
a few moments over your head to look down at you, and
then trots over to the far wall and down.
There is nothing at all unusual in what you have just
imagined. Geckos are famous for strolling up walls in this
fashion. How do geckos perform this gripping feat? Investigators
have puzzled over the adhesive properties of geckos
for decades. What force prevents gravity from dropping the
gecko on your nose?
The most reasonable hypothesis seemed suction—
salamanders’ feet form suction cups that let them climb
walls, so maybe geckos’ do too. The way to test this is to see
if the feet adhere in a vacuum, with no air to create suction.
Salamander feet don’t, but gecko feet do. It’s not suction.
How about friction? Cockroaches climb using tiny hooks
that grapple onto irregularities in the surface, much as rockclimbers
use crampons. Geckos, however, happily run up
walls of smooth polished glass that no cockroach can climb.
It’s not friction.
Electrostatic attraction? Clothes in a dryer stick together
because of electrical charges created by their rubbing together.
You can stop this by adding a “static remover” like a
Cling-free sheet that is heavily ionized. But a gecko’s feet
still adhere in ionized air. It’s not electrostatic attraction.
Could it be glue? Many insects use adhesive secretions
from glands in their feet to aid climbing. But there are no
glands cells in the feet of a gecko, no secreted chemicals, no
footprints left behind. It’s not glue.
There is one tantalizing clue, however, the kind that experimenters
love. Gecko feet seem to get stickier on some
surfaces than others. They are less sticky on low-energy
surfaces like Teflon, and more sticky on surfaces made of
polar molecules. This suggests that geckos are tapping
directly into the molecular structure of the surfaces they
walk on!
Tracking down this clue, Kellar Autumn of Lewis &
Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and Robert Full of the
University of California, Berkeley, took a closer look at
gecko feet. Geckos have rows of tiny hairs called setae on
the bottoms of their feet, like the bristles of some trendy
toothbrush. When you look at these hairs under the microscope,
the end of each seta is divided into 400 to 1000 fine
projections called spatulae. There are about half a million of
these setae on each foot, each only one-tenth the diameter
of a human hair.
Autumn and Full put together an interdisciplinary team
of scientists and set out to measure the force produced by a
single seta. To do this, they had to overcome two significant
experimental challenges:
Isolating a single seta. No one had ever isolated a single
seta before. They succeeded in doing this by surgically
plucking a hair from a gecko foot under a microscope and
bonding the hair onto a microprobe. The microprobe
was fitted into a specially designed micromanipulator that
can move the mounted hair in various ways.
Measuring a very small force. Previous research had
shown that if you pull on a whole gecko, the adhesive
force sticking each of the gecko’s feet to the wall is about
10 Newtons (N), which is like supporting 1 kg. Because
each foot has half a million setae, this predicts that a single
seta would produce about 20 microNewtons of force.
That’s a very tiny amount to measure. To attempt the
measurement, Autumn and Full recruited a mechanical
engineer from Stanford, Thomas Kenny. Kenny is an expert
at building instruments that can measure forces at
the atomic level.</p>
